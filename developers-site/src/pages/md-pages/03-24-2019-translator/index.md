## What is a translator and why do I need it? 

A translator acts as a standardization component between Platform of
Trust and applications using the platform to fetch information from data
sources. The translator MUST validate the signature coming from the
Platform of Trust Data Broker, as well as the headers.

Below is a Python example on verifying the headers and the signature:

Please note that if you're using a framework, such as Bottle, the
headers work using whichever case you want, but if you're not using a
framework, you need to lowercase the header name in the request, e.g.
`'X-Pot-Signature'.lower()` to make the validation pass.

```python
import base64
import json
import settings
from jwt.algorithms import RSAAlgorithm

# List of supported headers, and if they're required or not.
SUPPORTED_HEADERS = {
    'X-Pot-Signature': {
        'required': True
    },
    'X-Pot-Token': {
        'required': False
    },
    'X-Pot-App': {
        'required': True
    }
}

# Get the request headers from the request object.
headers = dict()
# Get the body from the request json body.
body = dict()

# Keep the Platform of Trust public key e.g. in the settings.
public_pem = settings.POT_PUBLIC_KEY

# Loop through the request headers and validate them.
for header, rules in SUPPORTED_HEADERS.items():
    header = header.lower()
    if rules['required'] and header not in headers:
        raise Exception(
            f'Missing required header "{header}"'
        )

# Convert the request body to a string, sorting the keys, without 
# indentation and using separators comma (,) and colon (:)
payload_string = json.dumps(
    body,
    sort_keys=True,
    indent=None,
    separators=(',', ': ')
).strip()

alg_obj = RSAAlgorithm(RSAAlgorithm.SHA256)  # RSA SHA256 signature
key = alg_obj.prepare_key(public_pem)
# Verify the payload and signature against the Platform of Trust public 
# key
is_valid = alg_obj.verify(
    payload_string.encode('utf-8'), 
    key, 
    base64.b64decode(headers['X-Pot-Signature'].encode('utf-8'))
)
if not is_valid:
    raise Exception('Signature validation failed')
```

When creating a translator, the standardization of the response is done
using JSON-LD contexts. Please define the contexts with the help of our
data modeling experts.

Two contexts MUST be defined:
- Parameter context
- Data context

The parameter context defines the parameters that are passed to the
translator. In the below example is a JSON payload that is sent to the
Platform of Trust Data Broker. The parameter context MUST define what
the keys in the `parameters` object means, and what their type is.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-04-10T14:36:25+00:00",
  "productCode": "unique-product-code",
  "parameters": {
    "apartmentId": 123456
  }
}
```

The data context MUST define the actual data response that the
translator returns. 

In the below example the translator returns the
actual data in the `data` object. The data context is the `@context`
within the object. The data context SHOULD define the keys within the
data object, e.g. `apartmentId`, `name`, `rooms`, `balcony` etc.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://standards.oftrust.net/contexts/identity-data_product.jsonld",
  "data": {
    "@context": "https://standards.oftrust.net/contexts/data_product-apartment_data.jsonld",
    "apartmentId": 123456,
    "name": "A 18",
    "rooms": "4",
    "balcony": true
  },
  "signature": {
    "type": "RsaSignature2018",
    "created": "2019-04-10T14:36:40+00:00",
    "creator": "https://example.com/public-key",
    "signatureValue": "eyXDfjefphhfwe...gwrg+wgr0=="
  }
}
``` 

The signature information MUST include the signature type,
`RsaSignature2018`, the created timestamp when the data was created, who
the creator is (the public key URL used to validate the signature) and
the signature value.

The signature is generated by adding a key `__signed__` in the data
object and using the corresponding private key to generate the
signature.

Python example of how to sign the data:

```python
import base64
import json
import settings
from copy import copy
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from jwt.algorithms import RSAAlgorithm

# This is the private key matching the `creator` public key.
private_pem = settings.PRIVATE_KEY

# Get the created_at timestamp in RFC3339 format
created_at = str(datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(timespec='seconds'))

# The data contains the actual data to return to the application.
data = {
    "@context": "https://standards.oftrust.net/contexts/data_product-apartment_data.jsonld",
    "apartmentId": 123456,
    "name": "A 18",
    "rooms": "4",
    "balcony": True
}

# Make a copy of the data, and add the __signed__ key to it
sign_data = copy(data)
sign_data['__signed__'] = created_at

# Create a string of the data, sort the keys, without indentation and 
# separators comma (,) and colon (:)
payload_hash = json.dumps(
    sign_data,
    sort_keys=True,
    indent=None,
    separators=(',', ': ')
).strip()

alg_obj = RSAAlgorithm(RSAAlgorithm.SHA256)  # RSA SHA256 signature
key = alg_obj.prepare_key(private_pem)
signature = alg_obj.sign(payload_hash.encode('utf-8'), key)

# Base64 encode the signature value and use it in the response
# `signatureValue`
signature_value = base64.b64encode(signature).decode("utf-8")
```

When the translator is implemented, using any of the below mentioned
methods, you need to register the data product in Platform of Trust, see
the [Data Product Guide](/guides/data-products).

## Use Python skeleton code as base

The first option is to build and setup a translator component yourself.
You can use our Python based translator to start from, see our GitHub
for the repository at 
[https://github.com/PlatformOfTrust/translator-skeleton-python](https://github.com/PlatformOfTrust/translator-skeleton-python)

The translator skeleton code should be pretty straight forward. It's a
Python Bottle application that you can host anywhere you want. The most
important parts to check are:

- routes.py -- Includes the routes for the API, default route is `POST 
  /fetch`
- controllers.py -- Includes the controller actions for the endpoints.
  The `Translator.fetch()` endpoint defines the arguments to be sent to
  the translator, e.g. `timestamp`, `productCode`, `parameters`. The
  parameters should be updated to match the parameters defined in the
  parameter context.
- services.py -- Includes the actual fetching of the data, mainly the
  function `get_data()` MUST be implemented. You can use any other means
  to populate the data, e.g. request data from another data source.
  Manipulate the response data to comply with the data context.

Please read the comments carefully when using the skeleton code as base.

## Buy as a service

The second option is to buy the translator as a service from IT provider
such as Tunninen.

If you are an application developer, it might be a good idea to read the 
[Application Development Guide](/guides/build-apps) first.

If you are integrating data and creating data products, take a look at 
the [Data Product Guide](/guides/data-products).

The open sandbox is your friend! It's an isolated environment for
testing applications and data product integrations. Read more from
