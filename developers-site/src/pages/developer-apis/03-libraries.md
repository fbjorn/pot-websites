To enable fluent data integration and application development we have created additional tools. 

### Translator

A Platform Of Trust translator standardizes the responses from a data source to the Platform itself. The translator also adds security measures, such as signature verification and signing the response. The Python skeleton is built with Python Bottle

You can use this skeleton to build your own translators. [Get the code from Github](https://github.com/PlatformOfTrust/translator-skeleton-python)

## Official libraries

Building on top of the individual APIs might occasionally be a bit cumbersome and therefore we have plans to provide libraries for common frameworks and runtime environments. We also encourage community to build more libraries and list them next to the platform libraries over here. First official libraries are coming during 2019. 

## Community libraries

We also encourage community to build more libraries and list them next to the platform libraries
over here. If you have an idea of a library, we would like to hear about it! [Add an issue to Github](https://github.com/PlatformOfTrust/developer/issues) or bring it up in Slack.
