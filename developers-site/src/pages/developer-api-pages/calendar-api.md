##General
The calendar API provides means to create calendar entries to identities. You can e.g. create an event for a housing company identity, a reservation to a room identity, or just a regular calendar entry to any identity you want.

##Capabilities
* All traditional REST API CRUD operations.
* Create calendar entries for any of the identities in digital twins.
* You can specify if an entry repeats. 
* Calendar entries can have carbon copy recipients similar to email. A notification about the entry will be sent to these users.

##Limitations
* No patch method.
* Not CORS enabled - requires authorization header.
* You can add only one calendar event at a time.
