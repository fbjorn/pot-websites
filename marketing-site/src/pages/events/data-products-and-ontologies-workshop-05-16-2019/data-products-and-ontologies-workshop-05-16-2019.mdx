What is Platform of Trust?
Communally built Platform of Trust provides a trustworthy and easy-to-use surrounding where you can utilize a vast data pool and develop everyday services for your customers with the help from the developer community and without a need for pricey and time-consuming integrations.

Workshop aim and purpose
Data products are one of the corner stones of Platform of Trust. Creating and maintaining data products must be fluent and fast. But what is a data product? How to define a data product? Those questions have been asked multiple times.

Before jumping into Platform of Trust APIs and other tools to create data products in the market place, one must define what is the data product to sell.

In this workshop we introduce draft version of Data Product Canvas which is a tool for business developers and technical people in cooperation define Data Product. Canvas tool is now being developed by Frostberry and Platform of Trust.

Initial ideas of Data Product GUI is also introduced by the Platform of Trust team.
