## Starting situation

Expectations for housing services are increasing though development is 
hindered by the fragmentation and incompatibility of data. With 
digitalization, the citizens can be offered more services to ease the everyday 
life. Before that can happen, it is first required to create a digital base throughout the housing facilities and parties building, hosting and maintaining them. 

## Task

In the autunm 2018, Platform of Trust, Kojamo, Visma Tampuuri and Lassila & 
Tikanoja (L&T) implemented an experiment together to make all partiesÂ´data 
move between systems in both directions and real-time. This was done without having to link all data providers together but with using Platform of Trust as a common platform for harmonizing and moving the data. The platform also pairs the data with real-world objects, like apartments, rooms and devices so that they are readable and understandable for machines to read. In practice, achieving this would result in more efficient service processes and customer (tenant) experience. 

## Action

The pilot was executed in a housing building in Karavaanikuja 2, Helsinki. The pilot was based on a construction-phase information model of a building that contained building and system data. In the first phase a digital twin frame was created of the building, apartments and systems. On the second phase a demo app was created for the tenants to use through which they could, for example, notify if something was broken or not functioning right. This information would then go to L&T ERP system and to the maintenance list. Once the task has been finished the information is communicated back to the tenant through the app. 

## Result

The pilot proved that linking data through Platform of Trust enables separate systems to function together. In this case, with the co-operation of different parties from the real-estate industry, the data was flowing after only a couple months of work. In addition, the capabilities build in this project are now available for other users without modifications. 

In the future this model enables more applications and digital services that speed up maintenance projects and make possible to anticipate and prepare for future maintenance needs.
