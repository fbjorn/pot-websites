# Why attend?

APIDays Finland joins the tradition of hugely popular global APIDays -events. The APIDays Finland event is brought to you together with our local APIOps community. 

Traditional industries are starting to catch up with digital transformation, partly because of the Finnish and EU -level legal requirements for industries to open APIs, even for their competitors and disruptors. 

The most established companies and organizations are getting on board. If your digital customer experience isn't cutting it, competition is imminent. The change is not easy in any industry, but it's even harder in regulated industries.

Banks and FinTech are already experiencing a forced change towards APIs and ecosystems, but construction, energy, traffic, and healthcare are needing to catch up fast. This change has been speeding up during the last 1-2 years and now it's time to present some of the case examples.

This event is not only for those already in the API and platform game or being challenged by recent legal requirements. This event is for sharing information, getting inspiration from customers, competitors and across industries, as well as experts.
