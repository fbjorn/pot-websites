            </h3>

            <p>
              The legal basis for personal data processing is your consent, the legitimate interest of the controller or fulfilling a contract made with the controller.

              We use personal data in the marketing and sale of our services and for customer relationship management, invoicing, provision of customer support services, user rights monitoring, and service development.

            </ul>


            <p>
              We typically receive the following information directly from the contact persons of our customers:

            </p>
